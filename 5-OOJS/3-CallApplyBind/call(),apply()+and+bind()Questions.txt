Q.1) What is the difference between call, apply and bind()?
call() -> is used to change the reference or context of this keyword 
apply() -> is used to change the reference or context of this keyword but only takes thisArg, and Array and it will destructure the array into parameters that pass into function
bind() -> same as call() method but doesnt execute immediately you have to use function expression
Q.2) What will be the output of this code? Or can you assign value to “this” object with assignment operator i.e. “=”?
const obj={
      a:6
}
function test(){
      this=obj;
}
test();
A.2) SyntaxError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment, if you want to change the this object you can use call(), Bind(), Apply()
