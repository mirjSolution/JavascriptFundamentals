Q.1) Explain the indexOf() and lastIndexOf() method with syntax
A.1) let str = 'This is a test'     
     console.log(str.indexOf('is', 5)) // 5 -> Search from beginning to end
     console.log(str.lastIndexOf('is', 4)) // 2 -> Search from end to beginning
Q.2) What is the difference between search() and indexOf() method?
A.2) indexOf() cannot be used for advanced search operation like regex
     The search() method can take regular expressions but cannot have starting position
Q.3) What will be the output of the below given code?
     Explain with reason?

     let str = 'This is a test'
     console.log(str.indexOf('is', 5)) // 5 -> the start position is index 5 it will begin looking for the word 'is' from beginning to end

     console.log(str.lastIndexOf('is', 1)) // -1 -> the start position is 1 and it will begin looking for word 'is' from end to beginning it return -1 because the word does not exist on the syntax
