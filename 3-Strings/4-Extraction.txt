The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.

The String object's charAt() method returns a new string consisting of the single UTF-16 code unit located at the specified offset into the string.

The charCodeAt() method returns an integer between 0 and 65535 representing the UTF-16 code unit at the given index.

Q.1) What will be the output of below code?
A.1) let str = 'Hello World'
     console.log(str.slice(-5, -2)) // Wor
Q.2) What is the difference between substr() and substring()
A.2) The substr() method returns a portion of the string, starting at the specified index and extending
     for a given number of characters afterwards.
     The substring() method returns the part of the string between the start and end indexes, or to the end of the string.
Q.3) What will be the output of the below given code?
     let str = 'This is a test'
A.3) console.log(str.substring(-5)) // 'This is a test' -> it cannot take a negative value but it will not give you an error and it will return the whole string instead
Q.4) What will be the output of the below given code? Explain with reason.
     let str = 'This is a test'
A.4) console.log(str.substring(3,3)) // nothing literally because the start index and the end index start at the same time
Q.5) What will be the answer of the below code?
     let str = 'This is a test'
     console.log(str.charAt('t')) // T
