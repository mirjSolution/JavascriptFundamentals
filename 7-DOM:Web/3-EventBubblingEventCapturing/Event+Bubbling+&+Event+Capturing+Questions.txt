event.target -> returns the reference of element which raised the event
event propogation -> when the event is trigger and travel to ancestor
the default path of event propogation is bottom to top which is called bubbling or event bubble
event.stopPropogation() -> will stop the event from bubbling
In case you want to change the default propogation instead from (bottom to top) from (top to bottom) then that will be called capturing.
For capture phase you have to use addEventListener() method to configure or bind the event
Capturing means from top to bottom
Events that are not propogated focus event

Q.1) Which is the default propagation path ?
A.1) bottom to top that is bubbling
Q.2) How can you stop the event propagation ? 
A.2) event.stopPropogation() method
Q.3) How can you change the default propagation path ?
A.3) It is called event capturing from top to bottom by using addEventListener make the third parameter true
Q.4) How can you get the reference of element on which event is fired ?
A.4) Using event.target, event.target.name, event.target.value
