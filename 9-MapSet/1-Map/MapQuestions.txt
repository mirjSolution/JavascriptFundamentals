Map -> is a data structure where are you mapping value to value
    -> Values inserted in Map collection are retrieved in the same order
    -> is iterable

    .set() -> is a method that returns the Map it's self
    .get() -> is a method to get a specific a value
    .size -> property that returns the number of key/value pairs
    .values() -> is a method that returns the value of the Map using for of ... loop
    .keys() -> is a method that returns the keys of the Map using for of ... loop
    .entries() -> is a method that returns both keys and values of the Map using for of ... loop
    .has(key) -> is a method that checks whether the given key is existing in the map or not
    .delete() -> is a method removes values by key
    .clear() -> is a method wipes out everthing from the Map

    Object.entries() -> method can be used to convert object into Map
    Object.fromEntries -> method can be used to convert Map into object

Q.1) What are the advantages of using Map over objects?
A.1) Maps keys can be values. They can be of any data type      - Object string only can be used in keys
     Keys, insertion and retrieval is always in the same order  - Object keys are not ordered
     size property that returns number of key/value pairs       - Object do not have size property
     Maps are iterable                                          - Object are not
     Maps perform better that object when it comes to data manipulation
Q.2) How will you iterate through Map ?
A.2) values, keys and entries methods and forEach allows to loop through the Map collection easily
Q.3) Can you assign key/values with this syntax?
map[‘key’]=value
Explain the reason for the answer.
A.3) Yes it's possible but it's the wrong way to assign values to Map collection it will look like using the Object data structure
Q.4) How can you convert simple objects to Map?
A.4) let obj = {
    pCode:1001,
    pName:'Orange',
    price:56
    }
    let m = new Map(Object.entries(obj));
    console.log(m);

Q.5) How can you convert a Map into simple objects?
A.5) let product = new Map();
    product.set('pCode','1001')
                .set('pName','Apple')
                .set('price',45);
        
    let obj = Object.fromEntries(product.entries());
    console.log(obj);

Q.6) How will you remove an item or all items from Map?
A.6) let product=new Map();
    product.set('pCode',1001)
            .set('pName','Orange')
            .set('price',56);
    console.log(product);
    product.delete('pName');
    console.log(product);

    console.log(product,product.size);
    product.clear();
    console.log(product,product.size);
