WeakMap -> are garbage collected when the WeakMap is assigned to null the values are sweep on the memory



WeakMap is Map-like collection that allows only objects as keys and removes them together with associated value once they become inaccessible by other means.

WeakSet is Set-like collection that stores only objects and removes them once they become inaccessible by other means.

Their main advantages are that they have weak reference to objects, so they can easily be removed by garbage collector.

That comes at the cost of not having support for clear, size, keys, values…

WeakMap and WeakSet are used as “secondary” data structures in addition to the “primary” object storage. Once the object is removed from the primary storage, if it is only found as the key of WeakMap or in a WeakSet, it will be cleaned up automatically.

Q.1) Explain difference between Map and WeakMap ?
A.1) 
    1. Keys in the WeakMap are only objects, you cannot have primitive types
    2. Keys are weak or weakly held and it means if the keys are garbage collected, so do the values
    3. WeakMap does not have iterable methods like keys, values and entries
    4. Weak collection does not hold values when the garbage is collected. This is very handy with the DOM where DOM nodes are removed and the garbage collected locations will be free as they not held strongly
