indexOf()       -> will search from beginning, default startIndex is 0
                -> this method returns the index number where the item is found
                -> when there is no searchElement in array then it will return -1
                -> If there are more than one matches found, it will return the index of the first item found
                -> case sensitive
                -> when there is no searchElement in array then it will return -1
lastIndexOf()   -> returns the last index of the found element
                -> By default start index is array.length -1
                -> case sensitive
                -> when there is no searchElement in array then it will return -1
includes()      -> method returns boolean values i.e. true or false
find()          -> method can take callback function which is called for each element
                -> find one value at a time and return the element or value
                -> if there's no find value it will return undefined
findIndex()     -> method can take callback function which is called for each element
                -> find one value at a time and return the index number of element or value 
                -> if there's no find value it will return undefined
filter()        -> method return a new array rather than a single value
                -> if there's no find value it will return empty array


Q.1) What is the difference between find() and filter() method ?
A.1) find() method returns only one value the first match and stops searching
     filter() method returns new array
Q.2) If there is no value to return, what will findIndex() return ?
A.2) it will return undefined
Q.3) What is the difference between indexOf() and includes() method ?
A.3) indexOf() method return only the index
     includes() method returns 'true' or 'false'
Q.4) How will you search multiple values in an array ?
A.4) filter() method is used to search multiple values in an array
Q.5) What will be the output of this code ?
        => let arr=["One","Two","Three","Four","Five"];
             console.log(arr.lastIndexOf("Abcd")); 
A.5) lastIndexOf or indexOf will return -1 if the value is not found
