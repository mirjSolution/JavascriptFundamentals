4 most known methods one can use to add or remove elements (push, pop, shift, unshift)
-> push and unshift use to add elements
-> push() method adds 1 or more element at the end of an array and it returns the new length i.e. count of elements after adding elements
-> unshift() method adds 1 or more element at the beginning of an array and it returns the new length i.e. 
count of elements after adding elements
-> pop and shift methods are use to remove elements
-> pop() method removes last element from an array and it return removed element
-> shift() method removes first element of an array and it return removed element
-> splice() method can add, insert, replace, or even remove one or more elements
-> splice() method is a fantastic way to deal with various types of operations within array
-> splice() method changes the original array which is not a very good practice in some cases


Q.1) What is the difference between push() and unshift() method ?
A.1) push() method adds the element ad the end of array whereas unshift() method will add the element at the beginning
Q.2) What is the difference between pop() and shift() ?
A.2) pop() method removes the element from the end of array whereas shift() method will remove the element from the beginning
Q.3) How can you insert an element at a given position ?
A.3) splice() method is used to insert an element at a given poisition ( arr.splice(0,0,'New') )
Q.4) How can you remove  a specific element ?
A.4) splice() method is used to remove a specific element ( arr.splice(2,1) )
Q.5) What does splice() return ?
A.5) splice() method returns deleted items, if there is nothing to delete then it will return an empty array
Q.6)  If there is no element removed then what will splice() method return ?
=> let arr=["One","Two","Three","Four","Five"];
     console.log(arr.splice(2,0,"New")); 
A.6) [] empty array, and it will insert New element to the array without removing or replacing an element in the array
