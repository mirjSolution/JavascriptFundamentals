What is the concept of GC garbage collection?
-> When you declare a variable, object, array or function it will be stored somewhere in the memory
-> When program ends the data inside location is garbage which needs to be cleared
-> Memory is releases when program ends 
-> In some programming languages you can call routine to clear the garbage and some languages manages automatically
-> In short clear these free locations is the process of collecting the garbage or garbage collection or GC

In Javascript
-> Javascript is a high level programming language you do not need to allocate memory
-> Memory allocations and releasing happens automatically
-> Making the memory free is the process of Garbage Collection (GC) and there is a routine who does it, called the garbage collector
-> GC is process is also called automatic memory managent with reference to Javascript
-> The garbage collection considers refererences and it tries to release the memory if a location is not reachable
-> Mark and Sweep Algorithm -> the algorithm starts from the root object and checks from the root object and checks for the references link
-> In case if this algorithm finds unreachable locations, then those are the location to be removed
-> Mark will mark all the reference items and values without any refernece will be unmarked and sweep or removed
-> All modern browsers uses mark and sweep algorithm.

Summary 
-> Memory allocations is done automatically
-> As long as references exist, there will not be any cleaning or garbage collecting
-> If a location is unreachable then that will be collected/released as garbage

Q.1) How does GC work in Javascript?
A.1) Mark and sweep algorithm is used for garbage collection.
     This algorithm will start from the global object and it marks the referenced values and unreachable locations are cleared 
Q.2) Explain Mark and Sweep algorithm's pattern?
A.2) The algorithm will start from the root element and then start making references values and unmarked values will be cleared
Q.3) Which situation can create memory leak?
A.3) If the reference is lost or unreachable, since javascript is a higher order programming language garbage collection is done automatically so you don't need to worry about it.
