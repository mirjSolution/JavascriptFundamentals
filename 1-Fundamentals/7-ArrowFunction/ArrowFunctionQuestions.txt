3 Functional behavior of arrow function
1. The 'this' object does not work with arrow function
2. 'arguments' object does not work with arrow function
3. You cannot use 'new' to call arrow function

Q.1) Explain the syntactical features of arrow function.
A.1) It is less verbose easy to use if you only have a return statement you can just do it only on one line of code and you can remove the parentheses if you only have one paremeter.
Q.2) Why 'this' does not work in arrow function?
A.1) No because in ES6 we have class keyword to deal with the classes so we do not need a function to act as a class
Q.3) Explain output of following code with reason.
const obj={
     method:()=>{
                      console.log(this);
      }
}
A.3) Normally if you use the traditional function it will refer to current context obj but if you use the arrow function the console.log 'this' will refer to window object
Q.4) How can you handle arguments object like functionality in arrow function?
A.4) You can use the rest parameter to deal all the parameters pass to the function
Q.5) Can you write IIFE with arrow function syntax?
A.5) Yes
