Q.1) Should you terminate all lines by a ";" ?
A.1) It is a good practice to put semicolon at the end but it is optional. If you do not put ";" then the line should not end in a proper way.
Q.2) Why this code is returning undefined in spite of function returning a valid object literal ?
         function test(){
   	 return 
   	{
      	         a:5
    	}
         }
        const obj=test();
        console.log(obj);
A.2) Because the ASI automatic put a semicolon at the end of return and end the statement that's why it returned undefined, but if you put the brackets after the return the output will be the object { a:5 }
Q.3) Can "use strict" statement or the strict mode change the behavior of ASI ?
A.3) No it doesn't change he behavior, if you write 'use strict' it does not mean you have to end all lines with ';'.
